<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am learning to code. My interest in becoming a Front End Developer
  started in 2020. I read about HTML, and learnt
  the difference of a Markup Language and real programming language.
  My interest grew with every youtube video I watched of "How to code with HTML" .
  Until I crossed path with CSS. I was over the moon, to see how much CSS can enhance a webpage.
  I think, I am still learning every day something new of CSS. But I felt like
  something still was missing. There were no big animations on websites I built.
  That is when I learnt about Javascript. At first, everthing seemed smooth and clear,
  but it actually set me off for 1,5 more years and here I am now again. Giving it once another shot.
